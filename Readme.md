# rstacruz/[vim-opinion](plugin/options.vim)

an almost-universal set of defaults that *most* people can agree on.
recommended for use alongside [vim-sensible].

[vim-sensible]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible

<br>

## Getting started

```vim
Plugin 'tpope/vim-sensible'
Plugin 'rstacruz/vim-opinion'
```

Doing a fresh install? Give it a try with [vundle] or [pathogen].
**[See instructions â–¸](doc/Starter_pack.md)**

## How do I override a setting?

Assuming you have both vim-sensible and vim-opinion, add these lines to your vimrc.
More explanation about this is available on [vim-sensible]'s Readme.

```vim
runtime! plugin/sensible.vim
runtime! plugin/opinion.vim

" Your overrides below the lines above
set noincsearch
```
